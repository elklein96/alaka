# Alaka

## What is this?

Alaka can tell you who that actor is. You know, the one you saw in that movie? With Alaka, you'll always know who and what you're watching.

## How does it work?

Alaka uses facial recognition to identify actors and subsequently searches for data about the match.

## Wow, that's cool. How do I get this?
